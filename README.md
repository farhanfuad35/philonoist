# Philonoist
Philonoist is an android app project. It offers a common platform where the students of a particular institution can post notices about available tuition offers so that other students can benefit from it.

A majority of the students in different universities are engaged in tuition. Even many of us often depend on it for continuing study and living. But most of the time it is not an easy task to find the right tuition when someone really needs it.

Mostly tuition notices are found in various varsity based facebook groups. But the posts are scattered in many group forums. One has to advertise the same tuition offer to a number of groups. And even then, these posts are frequently lost within a day or so. On the other hand, for the students who are seeking a tuition, it is also a hard task to find the tuition offers which meet his/her needs among all these scattered posts all over the groups. So we felt the lack of a common platform where the tuition notices are easily accessible in one place and sorted by oneâ€™s particular needs.

This app is archieved and no longer maintained.
